# Lift Simulation Project üè¢
A dynamic and interactive lift simulation project that showcases the movement of lifts and their interaction with different floors. This project is designed to demonstrate the operation of multiple lifts in a building, along with the ability to call lifts and make stops at different floors.

## Features
- Interactive lift simulation with visually appealing UI.
- Realistic lift movement and door animations.
- Ability to specify the number of floors, lifts and lift speed.
- Dynamic addition of stops during lift operation.
- Parallel operation of lifts, efficiently serving multiple requests.
- Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.

## Usage
1. Open the simulation in your browser by visiting [live demo](https://rk-lift-simulation.pages.dev).
2. Specify the number of floors, lifts, and speed using the input fields.
3. Click the "Generate" button to create the lift simulation.
4. Use the "Up" and "Down" buttons on each floor to call the nearest available lift.
5. Observe how the lifts move, stop, and interact with the different floors.
6. Reset the simulation using "Reset Simulation" button, this will free up memory and resources.

## Note
This simulation is a simplified representation and does not aim to replicate real-world elevator systems. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate basic lift movement principles.

## Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements, report issues, or submit pull requests.
