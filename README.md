# Lift Simulation Project

Welcome to the Lift Simulation project, authored by Rishabh Kumar. This project is a simple web-based simulation of a building with elevators (lifts) and floors. The simulation aims to demonstrate the basic functionalities of lifts moving between floors in a multi-level building.

## Overview

This project provides a visual representation of a building with multiple floors and lifts. Users can interact with the simulation by specifying the number of floors and lifts through an intuitive interface. The simulation then allows users to call the lifts to different floors and observe their movement.

## How It Works

The simulation is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core functionality involves the following components:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the simulation interface. It includes input fields for specifying the number of floors and lifts and displays the building layout along with lift movements.

- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the simulation interface, including the appearance of floors, lifts, buttons, and animations.

- **script.js**: The JavaScript file responsible for controlling the simulation. It handles lift movements, floor interactions, and user input processing.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: The simulation provides an interactive interface where users can specify the number of floors and lifts.

- **Lift Movement**: Users can call lifts to different floors, and the lifts will move vertically to reach the specified floors.

- **Dynamic Visualization**: The simulation dynamically updates the visualization of lifts and floors as they interact, providing a real-time view of the lift movements.

- **Priority Queue**: The simulation uses a priority queue mechanism to manage lift requests from different floors. It prioritizes lifts based on their availability and proximity to the requested floors.

- **Responsive Design**: The simulation interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Specify the number of floors and lifts using the input fields in the "Settings" section.
3. Click the "Generate" button to create the building layout with the specified number of floors and lifts.
4. Use the "Up" and "Down" buttons on each floor to call the lifts. The lifts will respond and move accordingly.

## Note

This simulation is a simplified representation and does not aim to replicate real-world elevator systems. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate basic lift movement principles.
